# hello-world
This is my first repo after deciding to learn to use github after all.

I am a Mathematics Post-grad student and I am very new to programming. 
I've been seeing github repos of my friends from a while and I've found this platform 
nothing but confusing, so I decided to finally dive into it and here I am...

This is my trial repository, created during the 'hello-world' tutorial.
